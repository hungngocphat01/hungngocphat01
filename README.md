  <h2> 雄鈺発 - Ohtaka Hiraki</h2>
</div>

- 🇻🇳 Nationality: Vietnamese.
- 🏫 fit@HCMUS, Quoc Hoc Quy Nhon.
- 🇯🇵 A weeb. Also interested in old Vietnamese writing system (Han-Nom).
- 📦 The public repos here mostly are some shitty projects that I wrote to serve some of my needs. There are some medium - large projects too, which are mostly the projects for my bachelor education.

- 💻 Current laptop: ThinkPad T14 AMD.

- <img height="15" alt="apple-icon" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Apple_logo_black.svg/505px-Apple_logo_black.svg.png"/> macOS simp used to use macOS (Hackintosh) as the main OS on my old ThinkPad T430s for almost a year.

- Familiar with C++, Python and Javascript.
- Mainly use VS Code as my main code editor. Sometimes I use vim as well.

- **My alias - Ohtaka Hiraki**: Vietnam used to use the Chinese-like writing system in the feudal age (like Kanji), so basically almost everything in modern Vietnamese can be rewritten in the old system. Since they are Chinese characters, they can also be pronounced in Japanese as well. My name is 雄鈺発 written in chữ Hán, and they can be pronounced as oh, takara and hiraki respectively. Combining all of them and simplifying the ‘ra’, we get Ohtaka Hiraki.
