- <img height="15" alt="apple-icon" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Apple_logo_black.svg/505px-Apple_logo_black.svg.png"/> macOS is by far the most fascinating operating system I have ever used in my life. I used to use macOS Mojave on my old ThinkPad T430s (Hackintosh) for about a year and I was very fascinated by its stunning user interface, as well as its nature of being a Unix-like operating system. <br>I will definitely buy a real Mac later in my life when I have had enough money.

- Familiar with C++, Python and Javascript.
- Code editor: VS Code, vim.

- Why I chose a Japanese alias: Firstly, I'm a weeb, and every weebs think it's cool to have a Japanese alias. More importantly, my alias is created based on the transliteration of my real name from Modern Vietnamese -> Middle Vietnamese (scripted in Hán tự, similar to Kanji/Hanja), so it can also be pronounced in Japanese. This is definitely a linguistically legit  weeb-ish alias.
