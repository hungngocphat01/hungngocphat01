- A weeb who likes writing code for fun.
- The repos here mostly are some trash pieces of code that I write to serve some of my needs, except for some large projects, which is either my homework or projects of my university club.

- Favourite operating system: Apple macOS.
- Since I don't want to pay that much money to buy a razor slim laptop with a crappy "butterfly" keyboard so I did install Hackintosh on my Thinkpad T430s instead. If you are also using a Thinkpad, then ah I see, you are a (wo)man of culture as well.
<br>I need Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Office so Linux is not my cup of milktea.
- Addictive to the Holy Terminal.
- Mainly use VS Code as my main code editor. Sometimes I use vim as well.
- Familiar with C++, Python and Javascript.
