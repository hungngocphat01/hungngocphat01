- A weeb who likes writing code for fun.
- The repos here mostly are some trash pieces of code that I write to serve some of my needs, except for some large projects.

- Favourite operating system: Apple macOS. Windows sucks. *nix masterace! (yeah I don't play games on PC).
- Since I don't want to pay that much money to buy a razor slim laptop with a crappy "butterfly" keyboard so I did install Hackintosh on my Thinkpad T430s instead. If you are also using a Thinkpad, then ah I see, you are a (wo)man of culture as well.
<br>I need Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Office so Linux is not my cup of tea.
- Addictive to the Holy Terminal.
- Mainly use VS Code as the main code editor. Sometimes I use vim as well.
- Familiar with C++, Python and Javascript.

- This is not how I normally use my "fake Mac" but, yeah, just because I think it is kakkoi to use the terminal in a way like this.
