- <img height="15" alt="apple-icon" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Apple_logo_black.svg/505px-Apple_logo_black.svg.png"/> macOS is by far the most fascinating operating system I have ever used in my life. I used to use macOS Mojave on my old ThinkPad T430s (Hackintosh) for about a year. I was very fascinated by its tunning user interface, as well as its wonderful Unix-like shell. <br>I will definitely buy a real Mac later in my life when I have had enough money.

- Familiar with C++, Python and Javascript.
- Mainly use VS Code as my main code editor. Sometimes I use vim as well.

- **About my alias - Ohtaka Hiraki**: Vietnam used to use a Chinese-like writing system back in the feudal age (similar to Kanji) called Han-Nom, so basically almost everything in modern Vietnamese can be rewritten in the old system. Since they are Chinese characters, they can also be pronounced in Japanese as well. My name is 雄鈺発 written in chữ Hán, and they can be pronounced as oh, takara and hiraki respectively. Combining all of them together and simplifying the ‘ra’, we get Ohtaka Hiraki.
